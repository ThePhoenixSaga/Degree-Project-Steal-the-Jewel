# Degree-Project-Steal-the-Jewel
A developing environment game for my degree project. Although being built as a game in general, its my attempt to demonstrate the use of finite state machines to create artificial intelligence. You play as a thief in a museum at night trying to steal the museums jewels. You have to avoid the security guard otherwise he''ll chase you and shoot you with his stun gun. Collect the main objective jewel in each level then return it to the start of each level to complete the level. Earn extra points by collecting the smaller gems scattered around the levels.
